## 🔒 Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Password Security (Issue #1)

**Problem:**
- Default password "password" in appsettings.json
- Development config had "dev123"
- Users could deploy with known passwords

**Solution:**
- ✅ Removed all hardcoded passwords
- ✅ Added password strength validation
- ✅ Blocks 20+ common weak passwords
- ✅ Enforces: 8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers
- ✅ Password strength indicator (Weak/Medium/Strong)

**Files Changed:** 10 files
```
ZLGetCert/appsettings.json
ZLGetCert/examples/*.json (4 files)
ZLGetCert/Models/AppConfiguration.cs
ZLGetCert/Services/CertificateService.cs
ZLGetCert/Services/ConfigurationService.cs
ZLGetCert/ViewModels/SettingsViewModel.cs
ZLGetCert/Utilities/ValidationHelper.cs
```

---

### 2. Command Injection Prevention (Issue #3)

**Problem:**
- Process arguments built with string concatenation
- No input validation
- Possible command injection via CA names, file paths, etc.

**Solution:**
- ✅ Created `ProcessArgumentValidator` class
- ✅ Validates CA server names (DNS format only)
- ✅ Validates file paths (no injection chars, no path traversal)
- ✅ Validates thumbprints (40 hex chars only)
- ✅ Validates template names (safe characters only)
- ✅ Safe argument escaping (.NET Framework 4.8 compatible)
- ✅ Improved timeout handling with process kill

**Attack Vectors Closed:** 6+
```
GetAvailableTemplates() - CA template query
CreateCSR() - Certificate request creation
SubmitToCA() - CA submission
RepairCertificate() - Certificate store repair
GetAvailableCAs() - CA discovery (2 methods)
```

**Files Changed:** 2 files
```
ZLGetCert/Services/CertificateService.cs (+100 lines)
ZLGetCert/Utilities/ValidationHelper.cs (+150 lines)
```

---

### 3. Memory Protection for Passwords (Issue #4)

**Problem:**
- Passwords stored as `string` in ViewModels
- Strings can't be zeroed from memory
- Memory dumps could expose passwords

**Solution:**
- ✅ Changed password properties to `SecureString`
- ✅ Implemented `IDisposable` pattern in ViewModel
- ✅ Added `Copy()` extension method for SecureString
- ✅ Passwords disposed immediately when cleared
- ✅ Constant-time password comparison (prevents timing attacks)
- ✅ Documentation for PasswordBox UI implementation

**Files Changed:** 3 files
```
ZLGetCert/ViewModels/CertificateRequestViewModel.cs
ZLGetCert/Utilities/SecureStringHelper.cs
ZLGetCert/Views/PASSWORD_UI_IMPLEMENTATION.md (guide)
```

---

### 4. Template/Type Validation (Issue #5)

**Problem:**
- Users could select "WebServer" template + "CodeSigning" type
- Would create invalid certificates with wrong OIDs
- CA might reject or issue unusable certificate

**Solution:**
- ✅ Added template intelligence (auto-detect type from name)
- ✅ Added OID/KeyUsage mappings for each type
- ✅ Auto-configuration when template selected
- ✅ Validation prevents mismatches before CA submission
- ✅ Detailed error messages guide users

**Template Detection:**
```
"WebServer" → Standard → OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1
"CodeSigning" → CodeSigning → OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3
"User" → ClientAuth → OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2
"EmailProtection" → Email → OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.4
```

**Files Changed:** 4 files
```
ZLGetCert/Models/CertificateTemplate.cs (+150 lines)
ZLGetCert/ViewModels/CertificateRequestViewModel.cs (+40 lines)
ZLGetCert/Utilities/ValidationHelper.cs (+65 lines)
ZLGetCert/Services/CertificateService.cs (+30 lines)
```

---

### 5. UX Simplification (Issue #6)

**Problem:**
- Confusing dual selection (Template AND Type)
- Not how sysadmins think
- 7 radio buttons for certificate types
- "FromCSR" as a type option (should be separate workflow)

**Solution:**
- ✅ **Removed entire certificate type selector**
- ✅ Template selection determines type automatically
- ✅ Added simple wildcard checkbox (only for web templates)
- ✅ "Import from CSR" as separate button/workflow
- ✅ Progressive disclosure - fields shown only when needed
- ✅ CSR import hides all fields already in the CSR

**UI Changes:**
```
REMOVED:
- 7 radio buttons for certificate type
- Confusing dual selection
- CSR file path section visible always

ADDED:
- Wildcard checkbox (context-aware)
- "Import from CSR File..." button
- CSR import status card
- Field visibility based on template

SIMPLIFIED:
- One selection: Template (not template + type)
- CSR workflow separate and clear
- Organization fields hidden during CSR import
```

**Files Changed:** 3 files
```
ZLGetCert/Views/MainWindow.xaml (-50 lines, +30 lines)
ZLGetCert/Views/MainWindow.xaml.cs (+5 lines)
ZLGetCert/ViewModels/CertificateRequestViewModel.cs (refactored)
```

## 🔍 Before & After Comparison

### Security: Before
- ❌ Default password "password" in configs
- ❌ Command injection possible via file paths/CA names
- ❌ Passwords in plain strings (memory exposure)
- ❌ No input validation
- ❌ Could create invalid certificates

### Security: After
- ✅ No default passwords anywhere
- ✅ All inputs validated and sanitized
- ✅ Passwords secured with SecureString
- ✅ Comprehensive validation layer
- ✅ Only valid certificates can be created

### UX: Before
```
[Template Dropdown]  ← Step 1
○○○○○○○ Type Radio Buttons ← Step 2 (CONFUSING!)
[Hostname] [Location] [State] [Company] [OU]
[SANs] [Password]
```

### UX: After
```
[Template Dropdown]  ← ONE STEP!
□ Wildcard (if applicable)
(Fields shown based on template)
[Password]
[Import from CSR...] button ← Separate workflow
```

## 📖 Knowledge Base

### Enhanced Key Usage OIDs:
- `1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1` - Server Authentication (Web servers)
- `1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2` - Client Authentication (VPN, client certs)
