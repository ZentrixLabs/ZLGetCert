## 🚨 Critical Findings

**DO NOT DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION UNTIL THESE ARE FIXED:**

1. **Plaintext default passwords in configuration files**
   - Currently: `"DefaultPassword": "password"` in appsettings.json
   - Risk: Anyone with file access can read PFX passwords

2. **Private keys exported without encryption**
   - Currently: .key files written in unencrypted PKCS#1 format
   - Risk: Private key theft from file system

3. **Command injection vulnerabilities**
   - Currently: Process arguments built with string concatenation
   - Risk: Arbitrary command execution via malicious input

4. **Passwords stored as strings in memory**
   - Currently: ViewModels use `string` for passwords
   - Risk: Password exposure via memory dumps

**Total estimated time to fix critical issues: 36 hours**

## 🔍 Verification Procedures

After implementing fixes, verify with:

### 1. Configuration Check
```powershell
# Check for default passwords
Select-String -Path "appsettings.json" -Pattern "DefaultPassword.*:.*\"[^\"]+\""
# Should return empty or "DefaultPassword": ""
```

### 2. File Permission Check
```powershell
# Check certificate file permissions
icacls "C:\path\to\certificate.pfx"
# Should show owner-only access
```

### 3. Key Encryption Check
```bash
# Check if exported key is encrypted
openssl rsa -in certificate.key -check
# Should prompt for password
```

### 4. Process Argument Check
```powershell
# Use Process Monitor to watch certutil.exe calls
# Verify no command injection characters in arguments
```

### 5. Memory Analysis
```powershell
# Use Process Explorer to inspect ZLGetCert.exe memory
# Search for passwords - should not find plaintext
```
