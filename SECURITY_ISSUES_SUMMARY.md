## üéØ Recommended Action Plan

### Week 1: Critical Issues Only
**Goal:** Make application safe for basic use

1. **Day 1-2:** Remove default passwords (#1)
   - Update config files
   - Force password entry
   - Add validation

2. **Day 3-4:** Fix command injection (#3)
   - Add input validation
   - Use ArgumentList
   - Test with malicious inputs

3. **Day 5:** Use SecureString in ViewModels (#4)
   - Update ViewModels
   - Change to PasswordBox controls

### Week 2: High Priority Security
**Goal:** Production-ready for IT environments

1. **Day 1-3:** Implement encrypted key export (#2)
   - Add PKCS#8 encryption
   - Set file permissions
   - Implement secure delete

2. **Day 4:** Fix SecureString comparison (#5)
3. **Day 4:** Update crypto defaults (#7)
4. **Day 5:** Add certificate validation (#8)

### Week 3: OT-Ready
**Goal:** Ready for OT/critical infrastructure

1. **Day 1-3:** Implement audit logging (#10)
   - Create AuditService
   - Log all operations
   - Windows Event Log integration

2. **Day 4:** Secure INF files (#9)
3. **Day 5:** Testing and validation

## üîç Quick Validation Tests

After implementing fixes, verify:

```powershell
# 1. No default passwords in configs
Get-Content ZLGetCert\appsettings.json | Select-String "DefaultPassword"
# Should show empty or removed

# 2. Exported keys are encrypted
openssl rsa -in test.key -check
# Should prompt for password

# 3. File permissions are restrictive
icacls "C:\path\to\certificate.pfx"
# Should show owner-only access

# 4. Command injection blocked
# Try certificate with name: test"; calc.exe #
# Should be rejected with error
```

## üìö Key Files to Review

### Configuration & Models
- `ZLGetCert/appsettings.json` - Remove default passwords
- `ZLGetCert/Models/AppConfiguration.cs` - Security properties
- `ZLGetCert/examples/*.json` - Update example configs

### Critical Services
- `ZLGetCert/Services/CertificateService.cs` - Command injection fixes
- `ZLGetCert/Services/PemExportService.cs` - Encrypted key export
- `ZLGetCert/Services/ConfigurationService.cs` - Config loading

### Security Utilities
- `ZLGetCert/Utilities/SecureStringHelper.cs` - Fix timing attacks
- `ZLGetCert/Utilities/ValidationHelper.cs` - Add input validation

### ViewModels
- `ZLGetCert/ViewModels/CertificateRequestViewModel.cs` - Use SecureString

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices for Users

### Configuration
```json
{
  "DefaultSettings": {
    "KeyLength": 4096,              // Use 4096 for OT
    "HashAlgorithm": "sha256",      // Minimum SHA-256
    "DefaultPassword": "",          // MUST be empty
    "RequirePasswordConfirmation": true,
    "AutoCleanup": true,
    "RememberPassword": false       // MUST be false
  },
  "CertificateParameters": {
    "Exportable": true,             // Only if required
    "MachineKeySet": true,          // For server certs
    "UserProtected": false          // Set true for high security
  }
}
```

### File Permissions
Ensure certificate directories have restricted access:
```powershell
# Set restrictive permissions on certificate folder
icacls "C:\Certificates" /inheritance:r
icacls "C:\Certificates" /grant:r "%USERNAME%:(OI)(CI)F"
icacls "C:\Certificates" /grant:r "SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)F"
```

### Password Policy
- **Minimum length:** 12 characters
- **Complexity:** Must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- **Avoid:** Common words, company names, keyboard patterns
- **Unique:** Different password for each certificate

   - Link to security documentation
   - Highlight password requirements

2. **User Guide**
   - Security best practices
   - Password management
   - File permission setup
   - Audit log review

3. **Admin Guide** (NEW)
   - Deployment security checklist
   - Hardening procedures
   - Audit configuration
   - Incident response
