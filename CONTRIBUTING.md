- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

### Examples

#### Good Commit Messages
```
feat: add JSON validator to configuration editor
fix: resolve radio button alignment issue in certificate type selection
docs: update README with installation instructions
refactor: improve error handling in certificate service
perf: optimize certificate generation process
test: add unit tests for configuration validation
chore: update .gitignore to exclude build artifacts
```

#### Bad Commit Messages
```
fixed stuff
updated code
changes
WIP
```

### Release Notes Generation

The automated release notes will categorize your commits based on the type prefix:

- **üöÄ New Features**: `feat:`, `feature:`, `add:`, `new:`
- **üêõ Bug Fixes**: `fix:`, `bug:`, `issue:`
- **üîß Improvements**: `improve:`, `enhance:`, `update:`, `refactor:`
- **üìù Documentation**: `docs:`, `doc:`, `readme:`

## Development Workflow

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3. **Make your changes** following the coding standards below
4. **Write good commit messages** using the convention above
5. **Test your changes** thoroughly
6. **Update documentation** if needed
7. **Push to your fork**: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
8. **Create a Pull Request**

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines
- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add XML documentation comments for public APIs
- Keep methods focused and reasonably sized
- Add appropriate error handling and logging

### C# Standards
- Use `var` when the type is obvious
- Use `string.Empty` instead of `""`
- Use null-conditional operators when appropriate
- Follow C# naming conventions (PascalCase for public, camelCase for private)
- Use `SecureString` for password handling

### WPF Standards
- Follow MVVM pattern
- Use data binding instead of code-behind when possible
- Keep XAML clean and readable
- Use styles and resources for consistent theming
- Add proper converters for data binding

### Security Considerations
- Never log sensitive information (passwords, private keys)
- Use `SecureString` for password handling
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize file paths and command arguments
- Follow principle of least privilege

### Testing
- Test your changes thoroughly
- Test in different environments (Windows Server, different .NET versions)
- Test with different certificate types and configurations
- Verify UI changes work at different DPI settings
- Test error conditions and edge cases
